Simple models for insight into trends in stocks


This is just a playground app for me to use while learning go (golang). Wanted something practical 
to build so working on a basic app for running scenarios for buying / selling stocks based
on indicators.

Yes, I know I shouldn't be using float64 for currency values, but until go gets support for decimal values - refer to
[#121270](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12127) and [#12332](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12332) it'll do for this demo.
